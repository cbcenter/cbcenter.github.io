### In Memory of Tony Pawson (1952-2013)

> Indeed, I think that new and unpredictable ideas flowing from fundamental research in the sciences and humanities will be essential for us to transcend the problems we face in combating disease, climate change and social upheaval. I personally envisage a world in which the diseases that afflict mankind are fully brought to bay, so that every child born into the world has the promise of a full and natural life span. At this challenging time in history, this may seem overly optimistic, but I believe that humankind has the genius, the altruism and the passion to make this a reality. As I said in my acceptance speech yesterday, we are a young and inventive species.
