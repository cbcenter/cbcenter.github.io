### Personal Background
- I am a bachelor student in Nankai University, majoring in Biological sciences and minoring in Mathematics. I worked as a research assistant in professor Zhimou Yang’s lab at State Key Laboratory of Chemical Medicinal Biology in Nankai University from 2016 to 2018 and in professor Nicole Horwood’s lab in University of Oxford from 2018 to 2019. I joined professor Ge yang’s lab from March 2019.

### Research Interests
- My primary research interests are in the application of computing and informatics technologies to problems relevant to medicine and biological sciences. I am particularly interested in methods for deciphering the mechanism behind organelle interactions. At present I am working on understanding the dynamic relationship between endoplasmic reticulum(ER) and lysosome in the cell.
